## Clusters

As decided in 2 March 2018 meeting with Stan Chodorow,
create samples of _dicta_ corresponding to the canons in Eichbauer's
Clusters A, B, and C (Sg 673).

Cluster A samples hand-edited from Gratian/corrections/dicta.txt.

Need to check C.13 q.1 _d.p.c.1_ and C.14 q.1 _d.p.c.1_ against
Melodie Harris Eichbauer's _Lectiones propriae in codice Sangallensi
673 repertae_, which is currently unavailable.

Cluster A: 13, 14 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 34  
Cluster B: 5, 6, 12, 16, 18, 21  

[Sg 673](http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/csg/0673)

C.5 q.2 d.p.c.4 (fol.74b)  
C.5 q.3 d.p.c.1 ยง1 'Ecce episcopus -- agere licet'(fol.75a)  
C.5 q.5 d.p.c.3 (fol.75b)  
_C.5 q.5 d.p.c.5_ (fol.75b)  

(Really pages -- there is not a _recto_ and _verso_ side.)
