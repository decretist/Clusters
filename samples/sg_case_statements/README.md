There are 3 versions of the case statements:
+ Friedberg
+ first recension (2016-08-15)
+ Sg (2013-09-28)

My version of Sg:
/Users/ple/Documents/Presentations/Rem Non Novam/Final/Sg.txt
(2015-05-13, week before Rem Non Novam)

Not clear what the difference between Sg.txt and Sg.sample is.
Both littered with <U+2028> characters.
g:/\%u2028/s// /gp
Rolled up into Gratian3.txt
